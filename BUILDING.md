# Building

Since this a Python application very little is needed to setup the environment. We have included the base set of 
requirements for the Viam libraries with the assumpthing that ROS2 python packages are installed and sourced 
from the ROS environment scripts.

To get started, fork the repository to your github account.

As you develop you can create a branch based on the improvement or fix you are introducing and create a pull
request as needed.

Over time our process might change as needed.
